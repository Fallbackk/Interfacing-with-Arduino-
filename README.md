# Interfacing-with-Arduino-
Assignment week 1
Build a circuit that contains two push buttons, an LED, and any other basic components you think you need. 
The LED should turn on when either the first button or the second button is pressed. 
Only use your Arduino for power and ground.
A video demonstration of the circuit in action has been uploaded using a simulator.
